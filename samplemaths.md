##Sample maths 
================
  

When $a \ne 0 $, there are two solutions to $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ 
      
\begin{align}
    |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle \\\\
    |\psi_2\rangle = c|0\rangle + d|1\rangle
\end{align}

Let's take $\mathcal(C) = Cat$  to be the strict $2$-category of categories, functors and natural transformations. Let $P:E \to B$ is a cloven Grothendieck fibration. We will show $P$ is a strict fibration in the sense of remark above. Let $B^\two$ be the arrow category (of $B$), $s:B^{[2]} \to B$ the domain functor and $t: B^\two \to B$ the codomain functor  and $\alpha: s \Rightarrow t$ the canonical natural transformation whose $f$-component is $f$ itself for any object $f: a \to b$ of $B^{[2]}$ .
